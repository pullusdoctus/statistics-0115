Parametrical Statistics
- Normalized data (Gauss distribution, bell curve): (average and variation)

Non-parametrical Statistics
- Unnormalized data: median

Descriptive Statistic Measurements
- Measurements of central tendency
  . Mean: the arithmetic mean, or the average. Sum of elements in set divided by number of elements in set.
  . Median: given a set of numbers arranged in increasing magnitude, the median is the middle number.
  . Mode: the most common element in a set of elements. The element with most appearances.
- Measurements of variation
  . Range: the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set.
  . Variance: the distance between each element and the mean.
  . Standard deviation: how far individual points in a dataset relative to its mean. The square root of the variance.
  . Covariance: the distance between two random variables.
